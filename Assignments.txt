Assigners: 07/02/19

Between screener and main we have a bunch of quota checks

RollBacks() is when you remove someone from a quota ... 

theres the If not (QuotaPend...) and If not Iom.debug etc...

Assigners: 
    Ask the quota to select among eligible items
    The assignment variable is multi punch. other variables are still single-punch
    so we would be able to assign certain quotas to different types of question

PendMonde: 
    qpNormal - default setting for single punch quotas
    qpRandom - select open categories at qpRandom
        (if coke and pepsi left jsust select ranodnm)
    qpLeastfull - selects the fewest completes + plus pending (if theyre both equal it defaults to random)
    qpLeastfullcomplete - if ones at 40/100 and 40/50 it thinks its equal but caps still work

Multi-step assignments 
    -select random ones 
    - priorirty for certain respondents 

Recommendations:
    Random vs most needed:
        random is better for reporting less skewing of data
        most needed keeps assignment more even, fewer interviews to hit minium per brand
    
    Slow to program:
        if each step requires a previous answer because it becomes a unicorn and thats why it is hard

    
    sometimes we cna pend quotas and all of a sudden one person doesnt hit the quota so what we do is rollback all the quotas we just pended
