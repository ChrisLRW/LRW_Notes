-Avoid the "Kitchen Sink Syndrome"
    i.e: can we throw in some questions about this... (no unnecessary qustion)
-We want to make our surveys smaller and more efficient; sometimes clients are being pressured to reach a "quota" on information
-Approach from the end to the beggining
-Business objectives guide the entire process

Qualitative vs Quantitative
    Qual = Why? how? : Quan = How many? What? Who?
    i.e toys: qual first = have kids just nteract then do quan for the chunk of info 
            Quan first = ask question then do qual based on that data

Communities - Hybrid Platform for Qual + Quan
Appended Data - Big Data
Web Scraping - Aggregation of publicly avaiable commends (Social media listening)

Q: What is it that we do that other companies cant do in house?
