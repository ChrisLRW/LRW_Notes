Custom Properties: 07/01/2019

-Create as many as you need
-attach them to anything in MDD
-They are properties of MDD, not variables
-They remain in the MDD after intervew 

Basics:
    they can store data of multiple types (text, long, double)
    More "Object Oriented" because we can create our properties etc..
    i.e RI = "Standard", RI = "Q4Info" 


Syntax:

    Hdata - 
    [
        JobNumber = "12345"
        StudyName = "Tracking"
    ]

    Flags "QC Flags"
    ' this is the custom property whihc is the square brackets
    [
        PrintRemove = true
        Shortname = "Flags"
    ]

Accessing values in routing is in the powerpoint

if a property isnt defined, it will match null or empty string "" so if you mispell a property name it wont crash itll just appear as an empty string or null

Some Standard Properties:
    GridCol - percent multiplier for grid response column widths
    qstyle = "custom" - reset.css basically
    Qtype = "Bipolar" 
    RemoveSpace = True - keep on the page/blcok items closer together


GetcatfilterFromProperyList(IOM, var1, var2, "Name of property")
Csustom error messagesErr = "Err"
