Categorical stuff: Immersion Survey Activity (P6698)
    Name ""
    Categorical
    {
        stub1,
        stub2,
        stub3
    }

    Name.Categories.Label

    or 

    for each x in Name.Categories   
        x.label 'access the label name
        'x is each categorical stub per interation
    next

    .DefinedCategories() - is used for accessing sublist and all stubs as well

Make a ranking a read only so respondents cant change it:
    HP Gamer: C3 BrankRank
    BrandRank[MostLikely].Rank.Style.Control.ReadOnly = True

QuestionFilter: 
    Kind of like category Filter but for QuestionFilter.
    In a grid there are cateogries and "GV" these can filter out the GV questions to specific
    cateogries 

QuestionName: 
    returns the name of the categorical stub in string form 
    180760 HP Gamer BrandLoop.Barrier:
        for each iter1 in brandloop.Categories
            'this returns te {A} , {B} ...
            Brandloop[iter1].ask() can work
        
        for each cat in brandloop   
            'this returns LoopName[{A}]
        
        so in order to do the ask you have to do 
            Brandloop[Ccategorical(iter1.questionName)].ask()
