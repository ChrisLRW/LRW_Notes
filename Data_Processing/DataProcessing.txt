'All the stuff for routing basically go here 
Event(OnNextCase, "")

create your own "name.ddf" 
and in the metadataoutputname = "name.mdd" make sure these are the same name just for organization
and you dont have to create this mdd it will create it when you run the process

inputsource 
metadata location: find the one u want the input off
case data type = data collection data file

In weighting Report
    orange - to much variance change in your data

Cap data
    We cap data 
    if smallest number is 1 the highest number CANNOT be 40 
    the highest number has to be 10

    wgt.minweight = .32
    wgt.maxweight = 3.2
    Talk to your TDM if they change the cap data
