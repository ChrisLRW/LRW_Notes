.dms Files can only PROCESS data (DMON Object)
.mdd can create interviews in metadata and routing (IOM - interview object model)

.mrs file usually for tables BUT it is an open ended script file (there is no dedicated object model)


Outputs:
    Tabs - tables in excel 
        Banners (top) - usually the same on every tables
        Side - changes 
    .mtd file - Tabs in the Reporter
    SPSS file - taking the .mdd and .ddf and converts it to a .sav file 
        .sav file - has all the data 

How to get it:
    P:/../IPS/Tables/(Shell)
    github -> Table shell repository 

D_export.dms:
    OLD (doesnt work anymore) takes in an input and exports it to our table folder
    
Includes folder: 
    You dont touch except maybe Globals
    Globals
        Line 16 = Project_Num

D_PrepData.dms:
    nothing for tables.
    main purpose is to change the P file to R file 
    - work in the OnNextCase and metadata section to change from P to R
    - theres an include for personal coded stuff thats in the coding folder

D_WeightData.mrs:
    weighting is an mrs not a dms therefore it is super fast (no onnextcase etc...)

D_PRE_Prep_Merge.dms:
    generic merge scripts. alot of comment code meant to be custom for each scenarios
    vertical, horizontal merges etc...
    Rapid Choice always requires Pre Merge data

D_POST_Prep_Merge.dms:
    post prep merge
    same thing but starts with Processed data (not pre source data)

S_(scripts):
    used to generate .ddf to spss Files

STK_(scripts):
    stacking

T_Run.mrs:
    Table Script - most important
    the only one we run. this includes T_banners and T_Table
    Apply_Weight - true/false  
    Banner_List - "1,2,3,4"
    T_Run_Option_Set - custom, html, etc...

Where are the banners getting defined?
    D_PrepData.dms & T_Banners.mrs

T_Banners.mrs:
    define the basic characteristics.
    just fill in the info of each banner

T_Tables:
    no code , just comments
    free form place for you to make all your tables

3 Important functions:
    
    set table = CreateTable(logMe, tableDoc, bannerNumber, "tableName", "questionName", "questionAxisOverride", "descriptionOverride")
    'put everything you want to customize onto descriptionAxisOverride 
    'axis({}) - u can free form an axis

    set table = CreateGridSliceTable

    set table = GridSummaryBase

    Tables Procedure (HW) Updated July 22, 2019:
        Step 3 - Basic DP, creating DV, simple Cleaning, D_PrepData.dms (You can add DVs in MetaData section)
        analysis link button - Creating an R Prkect. 
        Creating R Project (Manually) - 
            New Project:
                Analyze Existing data
                Upload files (.mdd and .ddf)
                if you follow all the steps correctly and clink on survey reporter it should work!

    T_Generate: generates tables and it wont work until you run prep data because it looks at the R file

    Gateway push : upload data in our projects
    
    When you upload the mdd through Dnet (it wont replace!!) itll merge the two together! You have to use gateway push to completely erase mdd files
    .. copy over the mtd, mdd and ddf files that gateway push folder creates


    Stat Testing:
        T_Banners change the "staTestLevel = 10" for 90% etc... "." stands for skip in the banner thingy
