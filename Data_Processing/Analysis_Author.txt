.sav is the extension 
SPSS is the software used to open the extension. Does not allow multi punch variables


single punch : 
    1 variable of however many stubs

Multi punch (5 stubs):
    since it doesnt do multi itll have 5 variables each with {yes, no} 

grid (5 rows 1 column) (single punch): 
    there will be 5 columns in the SPSS 

grid (N rows M columns) (multi punch):
    N * M data stored

Why? 
    Some projects like seeing data as giant excel file.
    Some clients have software SPSS and not reporter or profesional

Dont:
    Data Export on Dnet (DONT USE THIS UTILITY)

    If you try to export to SPSS through .dms (i.e punch {yes} to {interestedin}) it wont give you an error until you actually export 
    to SPSS. When you expot to an MDD and DDF if it doesnt give you that error (so we wouldnt know)
        itll genereate really really shitty naming (banner11) where if you change the mdd list then itll mess up all the code pertaining
        to this SPSS.
    

Analyis:
    download from voltron
    open excel
    load mdd and load button (click the buttons) find RXXX.mdd
    exclusions - this is where we remove the stubs we want for the export (Remove fro SAV = 1)
    Analysis Label - shows every variable label for the entire program
    ShortNames - these get copied from the shortname property in your mdd
        for numeric grids shortname for a field is an integer
        fill in al the yellows
    AnalysisValues - fill in all the yellows (ALOT) (hit the auto analysis button)

    yall should both click project team validation

    SL:
        if you used a shared list you have to use the same numeric codes! or else you will error

    ShortNames:
        Numeric Grids: use integers for the fields 
        Numeric Grids with opt outs are not considered numeric grids: we use short names (A1_Name) etc..

    Character limit: you can usually ignore

    DONT CLICK LOAD SPECS FROM MDD AGAIN!!
    CLICK COMMIT SPECS TO MDD


S_Prep, S_Create:
    Run S_Prep.mrs (remove variables) creates an SXXXX.mdd file which is a copy of the RXXXX.mdd file (with all the variables dropped)
    Run S_Create.dms - this actually creates your output -> Outputs folder RXXXX.sav file (zip up this file for delivery)

if we want to update stuff:
    D_Prep -> (to make changes)
    Commit -> (Save/Write FIRST) if you dont commit the (i.e banner2) is gone
    Load -> (Read the new stuff)
    then: sprep, screate to generate the new SAV


As an SE:
    load the mdd save and send it to them
        (they press the dark blue to autofill)
    (they give it back)
    press orange button 
    then sprep, screate = SAV file that you send for delivery

HW)
    download analysis from voltron on jive
    download table shell from github for Dp
    try to get a short project and try to do it
